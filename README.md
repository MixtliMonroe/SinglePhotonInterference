## Single Photon Interference

A 3rd year physics 2-week lab project involving single photon counting to verify the existence of entangled photons. This project was actually done in may 2025, but I uploaded it to github later. This repo holds all the (albeit messy) code I coded for my group of 3 as well as analysis. The API used in the project is in fact just a python wrapper of some C code, so I had to use C code knowledge to be effective.<br>
See `SinglePhotonInterference.pdf` for equally messy lab notes.
